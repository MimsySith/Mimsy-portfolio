# Conceit and Value of Portfolio Website

My website is an online CV for me as a full stack developer. Unfinished as of yet, when completed I hope to be able to show proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, and other languages. I have used Bootstrap to make the website adaptive to mobile devices, as it would have meant much longer and more unweildy code to have written it without Bootstrap.

I have followed a basic type of website design where the entire page is split into 4 boxes, and content distributed into each box. It tends to be easy on the eye, and adjusts well to mobile devices when the boxes can simply collapse.

## Problems addressed

I did have brief trouble with media queries until I remembered CSS reads top to bottom, and if you have more than one bit of code abut a unique type, the code closer to the bottom takes precedence.

I also had to carefully look at several websites about accessibility. This meant I made several changes, including but not limited to adding plenty of heading tags, adding a main tag to each page, and making the navbar light up when activated by the tab key as well as the mouse.
