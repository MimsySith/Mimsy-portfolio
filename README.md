## Conceit and Value of Portfolio Website

My website is an online CV for me as a full stack developer. Unfinished as of yet, when completed I hope to be able to show proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, and other languages. I have used Bootstrap to make the website adaptive to mobile devices, as it would have meant much longer and more unweildy code to have written it without Bootstrap.

I have followed a basic type of website design where the entire page is split into 4 boxes, and content distributed into each box. It tends to be easy on the eye, and adjusts well to mobile devices when the boxes can simply collapse into a row.
