                        When I was a bit older - not sure when - my uncle introduced me to Visual Basic, and I learned some of the extra functionality that came with the new language, although it was still very much in the design of the origial BASIC.<br>
                        
                        When I was 13, I suffered a devastating episode of mental illness, was hospitalised, diagnosed, and spent the next 17 years either in hospital or incapacitated at home. Don't believe the people who say mental illness isn't as serious as physical illness!<br>
                        At the end of this time, I was finally stabilised on a new medication and began a slow recovery. Since my education was interrupted by my long period of severe illness, I found most avenues of study and work closed to me. This annoyed me no end because I am intelligent and become bored and frustrated when I can't use my brain.
                        But it seemed that in a rarity, the world of coding cared less about what bits of paper you had from universities and more about your practical capabilities. I found an RTO that would take me, and began learning front and back end development. And here we are today.<br>
                        I am born and bred Australian and currently reside in the Victorian city of Melbourne<br> In my spare time, I enjoy birdwatching, bushwalking and nature photography. All photos on this website were taken by me.</p>
